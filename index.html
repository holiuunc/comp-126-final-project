        <p>Our organization seeks to promote cultural, political, and social awareness about the 
            Korean American community both on the UNC-CH campus and in the community at large; 
            KASA strives to establish a safe space for both students to celebrate our heritage and 
            discover new aspects of cultural and political identity. Membership is open to any and 
            all who are interested in Korean American issues!</p>
